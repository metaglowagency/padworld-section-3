PADWORLD ASSET DIRECTORY
========================

Place your custom images/videos here to override the default cloud streams.

1. HERO SECTION (Intro)
   - hero.mp4        (Main background video - 1080p recommended)
   - hero_poster.jpg (Static fallback image while video loads)

2. SECTION DIVIDERS (Parallax Images)
   - divider_1.jpg   (Neural Link Section)
   - divider_2.jpg   (Global Grid Section)
   - divider_3.jpg   (The Network Section)

SYSTEM LOGIC:
The application automatically checks this folder. 
If a local file is found (e.g., hero.mp4), it is loaded immediately.
If not, the system streams the default futuristic assets from the cloud.
